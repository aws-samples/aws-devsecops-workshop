Transitioning to DevOps requires a change in culture and mindset. At its simplest, DevOps is about removing the barriers between traditionally siloed teams; development, operations and security. In some organizations, there may not even be separate development, operations and security teams; engineers may do both. With DevOps, the two disciplines work together to optimize both the productivity of developers and the reliability of operations.

The alignment of development and operations teams has made it possible to build customized software and business functions quicker than before, but security teams continue to be left out of the DevOps conversation. In a lot of organizations, security is still viewed as or operates as roadblocks to rapid development or operational implementations, slowing down production code pushes. As a result, security processes are ignored or missed as the DevOps teams view them as a road block toward their pending success. As part of your organization strategy towards a security, automated and orchestrated cloud deployment and operations and you will need to unite the DevOps and SecOps teams in an effort to fully support and operationalize your organizations cloud operations

## Skills
Security specialist
 - Face a rapidly changing technology landscape
 - Prepared to dive deeper in AWS and take the Security Certification Specialty and learning path
 - How would codified security look like in an envirnoment you own?
 - Start with Python. Lambda, config, other SDKs

Everyone
 - Get in the mindset!


## Outcome
Security teams tend to be an order of magnitude smaller than developer teams. The goal of DevSecOps is to go from security being the "department of no" to security being an enabler.

By the end of this workshop, we want you to have some ideas on how you can accelerate your security teams to keep up with the development team. We want you to be able to react and detect vulnerabilities faster, using event driven architectures.
